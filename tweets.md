I will start with "Why Desktop Linux needs more GUI applications".

We all agree that there are millions of console-based powerful utilities available for Linux Desktop/Server & that's what makes Linux the only choice in server space.

But what about GUI applications for Desktop? Yes, we lag in this section if we compare the share with other major successful Desktop OS in the market right now.

Linux on Desktop has always been looked at as a secondary choice by users as most of us get Windows or MacOs preinstalled on our newly purchased systems. This has changed in recent times but the ratio is still very low.

It is also not very difficult to get a Linux OS installed on a system at present time. The problem starts when the user starts struggling to find good quality GUI applications,

One might argue on this statement but the Desktop userbase is very diverse. Users are coming from different backgrounds with different mental abilities and ways they use their desktop to perform a task.

An experienced Linux Desktop user feels very convenient performing tasks by popping up a terminal window, type a bunch of commands, and get the job done. But hey, not everyone is comfortable with this way of doing things.

We slowly need to change this, By making more GUI applications for Linux Desktop. I will share many new application ideas throughout this week, which we can make happen by collaborating in any possible way.

We will also discuss many reasons and challenges that we face while targetting Linux Desktop for developing GUI applications.
