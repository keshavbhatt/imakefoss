I will start with "Why Desktop Linux needs more GUI applications".

We all agree that there are millions of console-based powerful utilities available for Linux Desktop/Server & that's what makes Linux the only choice in server space.

But what about GUI applications for Desktop? Yes, we lag in this section if we compare the share with other major successful Desktop OS in the market right now.

Linux on Desktop has always been looked at as a secondary choice by users as most of us get Windows or MacOs preinstalled on our newly purchased systems. This has changed in recent times but the ratio is still very low.

It is also not very difficult to get a Linux OS installed on a system at present time. The problem starts when the user starts struggling to find good quality GUI applications,

One might argue on this statement but the Desktop userbase is very diverse. Users are coming from different backgrounds with different mental abilities and ways they use their desktop to perform a task.

An experienced Linux Desktop user feels very convenient performing tasks by popping up a terminal window, type a bunch of commands, and get the job done. But hey, not everyone is comfortable with this way of doing things.

We slowly need to change this, By making more GUI applications for Linux Desktop. I will share many new application ideas throughout this week, which we can make happen by collaborating in any possible way.

We will also discuss many reasons and challenges that we face while targetting Linux Desktop for developing GUI applications.

Before we jump in and plan to make a new GUI application targetting the platform, We should learn about different GUI toolkits available for it. So, today we will be discussing various GUI toolkit available for Linux Desktop.

Choosing a toolkit can be a challenging task. It is an important decision because it typically decides how your application will behave and work on the Operating system you are targetting. In this thread, I will give my opinions on the most commonly used GUI toolkits in the Linux Desktop ecosystem.

I will start by listing considerations one should make while choosing Toolkit for GUI application development:

-   Language of development: official support and bindings for programming languages.
-   _Native widgets support:_ produces widgets that render and look closer to other applications on the platform.
-   Availability of documentation and online support: provide easily accessible documentation for developers to learn how properly write implementations using different libraries.
-   Maintenance of the library bindings and the library itself.

Yesterday I shared many GUI toolkits and how one can get started using them to create applications for Linux Desktop and contribute to FOSS. Today we will talk about various ways developers can share their creation with a bigger audience.

Once you have developed an application that runs on your local machine, You wish to share it with a wider audience. There has been an issue in the past where the developer had to package their applications in different formats to make it available on various Linux distributions.

But in a few recent years, Thanks to the universal Linux applications packaging formats like AppImage, Flatpak, and Snaps. Now applications packaged in one of these formats ensures that it will run as expected on a wide range of supported Linux Distros.

#### AppImage 
Distribute your desktop Linux application in the AppImage format and win users running all common Linux distributions. Package once and run everywhere. Reach users on all major desktop distributions. 

*Learn more:* https://docs.appimage.org/packaging-guide/index.html

#### Flatpak
 Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications on Linux. It has been created by developers who have a long history of working on the Linux desktop and is run as an independent open source project. 
 
*Learn more:* https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/

#### Snapcraft 
Snapcraft is a powerful and easy to use command-line tool for building snaps. Snaps are app packages for desktop, cloud, and IoT that are easy to install, secure, cross-platform and dependency-free.

Yesterday we talked about different ways developers can share their creation in Linux Desktop Ecosystem.

Since I am putting my efforts particularly on How we can broaden the App ecosystem of Linux on Desktop, Today I will try to put some light on how we are behind in this section in comparison to corporate-backed proprietary counterparts. 

Also, last I specifically chose to include three universal Linux app binary formats or containers. I will give my reason for this too.    

These thoughts are my personal and are not to hurt the feelings of people who are happy with the existing state of the Linux Desktop App ecosystem. 

I think that User Applications plays a vital role in making the newcomers stay using any Operating system. Ex. Windows XP is still used in many businesses (not because people love the Desktop environment it comes with, No harsh feeling for the D.ev developers) due to the compatibility of applications they are using in their business environment. 

These businesses using Windows XP still contributes to the market share of Windows OS. XP market share is still higher than Ubuntu acc. to the first search result on Google (http://bit.do/xpmshare). 

One reason most of us are familiar with why new users are unable to port to Linux is that they do not find applications they were using on the OS they are coming from. And those particular applications are not made available here because their owners/developers think porting their app for an OS with a low market share is a waste of resources. This is what you will get in response if you ask them to port their app for Linux Desktop. While at the same time they are good to put their resources in OS like Android that is also a Linux-based mobile Operating system. 

I have been seeing major changes and good upgrades in Linux Desktop since I am using it, Most of what I saw is the changes in User experience and UI, that comes from the development of the Desktop environment. This is what a normal user will notice. They do not care/know about OS vitals and low-level stuff that it does. Here Linux Desktop developers need to make their scope wider and target a wider audience and not just computer geeks.

So what is stopping people from stay using Linux on their Desktop? Certainly not the Desktop environment but the poor app ecosystem for both developers and the users.

Here if I have proven that applications play a major role in deciding the market share of an OS, let's take some real-world example by searching for simple little utilities on storefronts of all major desktop OS's, 

I will post a few screenshots showing the availability of basic applications just for example:

![Flathub search results for Currency Converter](https://github.com/keshavbhatt/imakefoss/blob/main/images/comp/flathub.png?raw=true)

![Snapcraft search results for Currency Converter](https://github.com/keshavbhatt/imakefoss/blob/main/images/comp/snapcraft.png?raw=true)

![MacOs store search results for Currency Converter](https://github.com/keshavbhatt/imakefoss/blob/main/images/comp/macos.png?raw=true)

![Windows store search results for Currency Converter](https://github.com/keshavbhatt/imakefoss/blob/main/images/comp/windows.png?raw=true)

It's hard to disagree that Linux Desktop lag when it comes to GUI applications, I can make thousands of similar examples but this is enough to understand the point. 

Linux users who can give their time and efforts can pay back to the community and FOSS by creating a thriving GUI application ecosystem (just like we have of console-based applications) for all newcomers. So they can stay longer and keep using the Linux Desktop & not go away just because they can not spend their time learning all these command-line utilities.

Yesterday its was a busy day for me, within the last 17 hours after I shared the tweet showing the amount of application search results that came out when I tried to search for a simple Currency converter application in different OS stores.
 I got myself busy writing a little utility to fill up that result count in one of the Linux Desktop Storefronts. 
Though I was not able to create much attention with my example, I hope a few of you were able to get the point. Most of the apps I developed in past are just came out like this. I don't know how this can inspire other people but I enjoy doing this by myself. Publishing applications for Linux Desktop is a very pleasant experience nowadays, thanks to the availability of Universal application packages like Snaps, Flatpak, and Appimages. 
These packaging formats ensures that apps you publish will run on all modern Linux Desktop OS's and cuts down the maintenance burden for us developers. 
Currency Converter was just a little example, There are a lot of app ideas I will be sharing today with you guys in this same thread. You are also welcome to engage and pass your app ideas in replies.

For the few coming days I will be adding new features/improving my newly published app [http://snapcraft.io/currencyconv](http://snapcraft.io/currencyconv) (i have received many suggestions from people), you guys are welcome to contribute however you feel like. 

Next am going to share few app ideas for Linux Desktop.

- An app to make DOODLE videos: A few days ago, I was looking for an application similar to [http://doodly.com](https://t.co/C2IWv6KQkZ?amp=1 "http://doodly.com") for making some sort of doodle videos. It's a nice opportunity for anyone interested in making one natively for Linux Desktop.
- An app for signing PDFs We lack PDF signing tools here on Linux. Most of the available options are outdated or are no longer maintained. Lots of businesses need this tool for Digitally signing the documents they share.
- A Simple Image Editor, and an Image converter A Simple Image Editor like Fotor for macOs ([https://apps.apple.com/in/app/fotor-photo-editor/id503039729?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4…](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/fotor-photo-editor/id503039729?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)) and a simple batch Image converter like ([https://apps.apple.com/in/app/image-converter-for-png-jpeg-gif/id1168928374?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4…](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/image-converter-for-png-jpeg-gif/id1168928374?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)) .

The list is endless, one can explore more ideas using many web based app store alternatives of other OS's. MacOs - [https://theappstore.org](https://theappstore.org/) Windows - [https://microsoft.com/en-in/store/apps/windows…](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/store/apps/windows)
